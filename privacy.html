          <p>
            We employ common web technologies that help to manage our web site, among them:
          </p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li><span>Cookies</span> – A "cookie" is a name for tokens of information that our
              web site may provide to your browser, which is used only by our web sites while
              you are at those web sites. my wings.com uses cookies for a variety of purposes.
              We use cookies to help us better understand web site usage in the aggregate so that
              we know what areas of our site users prefer. We also use cookies to simplify your
              data entry for some of our online forms. If you simply want to browse, you do not
              have to accept cookies from our site. Should you decide, however, that you would
              like to register and login to special areas of the web site, and you have modified
              your browser settings not to accept cookies, you will need to re-set your browser
              to accept the cookies that we send it. Otherwise, you may not be able to participate
              in certain areas of the web site. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain
              cookies. </li>
            <li><span>Web Site Usage Data</span> – With or without cookies, our web site keeps
              track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from
              (i.e., your IP address, domain name), date and time of the page request, the referring
              web site (if any), and other parameters in the URL (e.g., search criteria). We use
              this data to better understand web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what
              areas our web site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas).
              This information is stored in log files and used for aggregated and statistical
              reporting. It is not attributed to you as an individual. </li>
            <li><span>Links to Third Party Sites</span> – Our web sites often provide links
              to third party web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers.
              You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why, and how
              they collect and use personally identifiable information.</li>
            <li><span class="bl">Links to External Sites</span> – Our privacy policy only applies to the
              my wings.com network. It does not apply to non-network sites that you connect to
              from our site. We recommend that you read their privacy policy to understand how
              they manage personal information. We choose our partners and sponsors carefully.
              However, we are not responsible for the content or practices of web sites operated
              by third parties that are linked to our sites. These links are provided as a service
              to our users. Unless otherwise stated, they do not constitute our endorsement, sponsorship
              or approval of their content, policies or practices.</li>

          <p class="bl">General</p>
          <br>
          <p>If we change our information handling practices or other privacy aspects, we will give you as much notice
            as possible prior to implementation. In rare cases, just like with any company or person, we may need to
            disclose certain information to comply with a valid legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or
            search. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.</p>
